This is a complete recipe system using Python + Django. A complete demonstration is live at [http://recipes.davidgrant.ca/cookbook/](http://recipes.davidgrant.ca/cookbook/).

Features
========

* Most important models, such as Recipe, Food, Ingredient, Direction, Category, and a few more.
* Very nice admin interface for creating recipes with inline ingredients and directions.
* Front-end: only a recipe_list and recipe_detail so far, but the recipe_detail has an experimental method of displaying recipes that is based on this LaTeX style: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cooking/ (apparently based on style in a famous German cookbook by Dr. Oetker (Gromzik, J.; Reich, C.; Sander, C. (ed.): Dr. Oetker Schulkochbuch â€“ Das Original. Ceres, Bielefeld, 1996.)
* Automatic conversion from imperial weights and volumes to grams
* Automatic nice formatting of imperial volumes.
* Uses South database migration system.

Competitors/related projects
============================

* KRecipes - KDE-based desktop recipes software.
* Ben Collins-Sussman's effrecipes - Simple, but it works. Not under active development.
* Recipes on Rails - Ruby on Rails recipes site. Not open source as far as I know. Embeds "Source: Recipes on Rails" on all photos and has google ads. Great site though. One thing it has that my site lacks is per-direction photos. This would be easy to do. I already have per-direction ingredients.

If you are aware of any other similar projects please let me know. I am especially interested in any other web-based and open-source cookbook projects...

Getting started
